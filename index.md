## About

Hello! I'm Korede, a third-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Georgia working in the ScalaTion research group with [Dr. John A. Miller](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~John_A._Miller1) ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K7j2Uk8AAAAJ&hl=en)). My dissertation focuses on building trustworthy microscopic traffic simulation models for high-stakes infrastructure decisions where field experimentation is not feasible.

I extend the open-source [Scalation 2.0](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_2.0) framework with lane-level validation, constrained calibration pipelines, and scenario-analysis tooling using California PeMS sensor data.

## Research Interests

- Discrete event/time-stepped simulation for transportation systems
- Lane-level validation and calibration of microscopic freeway models
- Constrained optimization for physically valid simulation parameters
- Infrastructure resilience analysis under extreme disruption (e.g., wildfire evacuation)
- Trustworthy AI/ML for high-stakes mobility and public policy applications
