## About

Hello! I'm Korede, a third-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Georgia working in the Modeling, Simulation & Analytics Lab (MSAL) with [Dr. John A. Miller](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~John_A._Miller1) ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K7j2Uk8AAAAJ&hl=en)). My research centers on lane-level traffic simulation, trustworthy AI, and digital twins that adapt to urban mobility dynamics in real time.

At MSAL, I design real-time digital twin frameworks that couple online calibration, parameter-free optimization, and graph-based forecasting. I also contribute to the open-source [Scalation 2.0](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_2.0) ecosystem, integrating stochastic simulation, optimization, and machine learning for microscopic traffic modeling.

## Research Interests

- Applied vision techniques for perception, prediction, and system optimization in transportation
- Lane-level digital twin infrastructure and sensor fusion pipelines
- Real-time calibration and parameter-free optimization for mobility systems
- Graph-based spatiotemporal forecasting and trustworthy ML for transportation
- Responsible deployment of AI/ML in high-stakes domains such as mobility and healthcare
