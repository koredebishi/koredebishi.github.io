    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Georgia working in the Modeling, Simulation &amp; Analytics Lab (MSAL) under the supervision of <a href="https://openreview.net/profile?id=~John_A._Miller1">Dr. John A. Miller</a>.</p>
    <p>My research focuses on discrete-event and time-stepped simulation, simulation-based optimization, and lane-level validation of microscopic traffic models using empirical sensor data from the <a href="https://pems.dot.ca.gov/">California Performance Measurement System (PeMS)</a>.</p>
    <p>I extend the <a href="https://github.com/scalation/scalation_2.0">ScalaTion 2.0</a> simulation framework with lane-level validation, constrained calibration infrastructure, and structural intervention modeling for high-stakes infrastructure scenarios.</p>

    <h2>Dissertation Theme</h2>
    <p>My dissertation investigates the following central question:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Can we construct lane-level microscopic traffic simulations that are sufficiently validated and calibrated to support counterfactual resilience analysis under extreme disruption — where real-world experimentation is infeasible?</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This research integrates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discrete-event and time-stepped simulation</li>
      <li>Simulation-based optimization</li>
      <li>Lane-level empirical validation</li>
      <li>Infrastructure resilience modeling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The objective is to build data-calibrated digital twins capable of evaluating structural interventions under high-stakes conditions.</p>

    <p>Three connected studies: (1) identifying which modeling choices materially affect accuracy, (2) constrained calibration of car-following models, and (3) wildfire evacuation resilience analysis under disruption scenarios.</p>
